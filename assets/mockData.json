      "description": "E.ON SE operates as an energy company.\r\n\r\nSegments\r\n\r\nThe company operates through three segments: Energy Networks, Customer Solutions, and Renewables. The company’s non-strategic operations are reported under Non-Core Business.\r\n\r\nEnergy Networks\r\n\r\nThis segment consists of the company’s power and gas distribution networks and related activities. It is subdivided into three regional markets: Germany, Sweden, and East-Central Europe/Turkey (which consists of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Turkey).\r\n\r\nThis segment’s main tasks include operating its power and gas networks safely and reliably, carrying out any necessary maintenance and repairs, and expanding its networks, which frequently involves adding customer grid connections.\r\n\r\nEnergy networks link the company’s customers together and are the hub for grid digitalization, such as the direct marketing of distributed energy. In Germany, approximately one third of distributed generating capacity subsidized by the Renewable Energy Law is connected to the company’s networks.\r\n\r\nCustomer Solutions\r\n\r\nThis segment serves as the platform for working with the company’s customers to shape Europe’s energy transition. This includes supplying customers in Europe (excluding Turkey) with power, gas, and heat, as well as with products and services that improve their energy efficiency and autonomy.\r\n\r\nThe company’s activities are tailored to the individual needs of customers across all segments, such as residential, small and medium sized enterprises, large commercial and industrial, and public entities. The company’s main presence in this business is in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania. E.ON Connecting Energies, which provides customers with distributed energy solutions, is also part of this segment.\r\n\r\nThe company is expanding its offerings in the physical and digital new energy world for municipal, public, industrial, commercial, and residential customers in regional markets. In addition, the company would continually improve or redefine its portfolio of products and services in response to customers’ demand for energy efficiency, distributed generation and storage, and sustainable mobility solutions.\r\n\r\nRenewables\r\n\r\nThis segment consists of onshore wind/solar and offshore wind/other. The company plans, builds, operates, and manages renewable generation assets. The company markets their output in various ways, such as in conjunction with renewable incentive programs, under long term electricity supply agreements with key customers, and directly to the wholesale market.\r\n\r\nThe company’s international renewables business focuses in target regions (Europe and North America) and customer-relevant technologies (onshore and offshore wind and photovoltaic) for network companies, energy suppliers, large customers, wholesale markets, and government subsidy programs.\r\n\r\nNon-Core Business\r\n\r\nThis segment consists of the company’s non-strategic operations, in particular the operation of its nuclear power stations in Germany (which is managed by its PreussenElektra of Hanover unit).\r\n\r\nGenerating Capacity\r\n\r\nAs of December 31, 2016, the company’s generating capacity was 4,176 MW.\r\n\r\nStrategy\r\n\r\nThe company’s strategy focuses on the new energy world of empowered and proactive customers, renewables and distributed energy, energy efficiency, local energy systems, and digital solutions.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strategy reflects three fundamental market developments and corresponding growth businesses, such as the global trend toward renewables (particularly wind and solar), the evolution of energy networks into a platform for distributed-energy solutions, and customers’ changing needs.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nE.ON SE was founded in 1923.",
