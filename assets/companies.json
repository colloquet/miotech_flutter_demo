      "name": "Twitter, Inc.",
      "description": "Twitter, Inc. operates as a global platform for public self-expression and conversation in real time.\r\n\r\nProducts and Services for Users\r\n\r\nThe company’s primary service, Twitter, allows people to consume, create, distribute and discover content and has democratized content creation and distribution. The reach of Twitter content is not limited to the company’s logged-in users on the Twitter platform, but rather extends to a major global audience.\r\n\r\nThe public nature of the Twitter platform allows the company and others to extend the reach of Twitter content beyond its properties. Media outlets and the company’s platform partners distribute Tweets beyond its properties to complement their content by making it relevant. These outlets and partners also add value to the company’s user experience by contributing content to its platform. Majority of the world’s media outlets, including the BBC, CNN, Bloomberg and the Associated Press, use Twitter as a platform for content distribution.\r\n\r\nProducts and Services for Advertisers\r\n\r\nThe company’s Promoted Products enable its advertisers to promote their brands, products and services, amplify their visibility and reach, and extend the conversation around their advertising campaigns. The company enables its advertisers to target an audience based on various factors, including a user’s Interest Graph. The Interest Graph maps, among other things, interests based on users followed and actions taken on the company’s platform, such as Tweets created and engagement with Tweets.\r\n\r\nThe company’s Promoted Products are incorporated into its platform as native advertising and are designed to be as compelling and useful to its users as organic content on the company’s platform. The company’s Promoted Products consist of the following:\r\n\r\nPromoted Tweets: Promoted Tweets appear within a user’s timeline, search results or profile pages just like an ordinary Tweet regardless of device. Using the company’s proprietary algorithm and understanding of each user’s Interest Graph, the company could deliver Promoted Tweets that are intended to be relevant to a particular user. The company’s intention is to enable advertisers to create and optimize marketing campaigns — and pay either on impressions delivered or pay only for the user actions that are aligned with their marketing objectives. As a result, the company has added product features to Promoted Tweets based on advertiser objectives, which might include Tweet engagements (retweets, replies and likes), Website clicks or conversions, mobile application installs or engagements, obtaining new followers, or video views.\r\n\r\nPromoted Accounts: Promoted Accounts appear in the same format and place as accounts suggested by the company’s Who to Follow recommendation engine, or in some cases, in Tweets in a user’s timeline. Promoted Accounts provide a way for the company’s advertisers to improve a community of users who are interested in their business, products or services.\r\n\r\nPromoted Trends: Promoted Trends appear at the top of the list of trending topics or timeline for an entire day in a particular country or on a global basis. When a user clicks on a Promoted Trend, search results for that trend are shown in a timeline and a Promoted Tweet created by the company’s advertisers is displayed to the user at the top of those search results. The company features one Promoted Trend per day per geography.\r\n\r\nAdvertisers could also run short video ads, such as In-Stream video ads, either before or around premium video content, such as during live premium video content from publishing partners or clips from various interest categories, such as news, sports and entertainment. Its technology inserts those advertisers' ads into the relevant videos and delivers the ads to the audience targeted by those advertisers.\r\n\r\nThe company’s technology platform and information database enable it to provide targeting capabilities based on audience attributes, such as geography, interests, keyword, television conversation, content, and devices that make it possible for advertisers to promote their brands, products and services, amplify their visibility and reach, and complement and extend the conversation around their advertising campaigns.\r\n\r\nThe company’s platform also allows customers to advertise across the mobile ecosystem, both on Twitter’s owned and operated properties, as well as off Twitter on third-party publishers’ Websites, applications and other offerings, across the full user lifecycle — from acquiring new users to engaging existing users. The company enables advertisers to extend their reach beyond Twitter through:\r\n\r\nMoPub, the company’s mobile-focused advertising exchange, which combines ad serving, ad network mediation and a real-time bidding exchange into one monetization platform.\r\n\r\nTwitter Audience Platform, an advertising offering that enables advertisers to extend their advertising campaigns with Twitter Promoted Products to audiences off Twitter while retaining access to Twitter’s measurement, targeting and creative tools.\r\n\r\nProducts for Developers and Data Partners\r\n\r\nThe company provides a set of tools, public APIs and embeddable widgets that developers could use to contribute their content to its platform, syndicate and distribute Twitter content across their properties and improve their Websites and applications with Twitter content.

      "name": "Scientific Games Corporation",
      "description": "Scientific Games Corporation operates as a developer of technology-based products and services and associated content for the gaming, lottery, social and digital gaming industries worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe company’s portfolio of revenue-generating activities primarily includes supplying gaming machines and game content, casino-management systems and table game products and services to licensed gaming entities; providing instant and draw-based lottery products, lottery systems and lottery content and services to lottery operators; providing social casino solutions to retail consumers and regulated gaming entities, as applicable; and providing a suite of digital real-money gaming (RMG) and sports wagering solutions, distribution platforms, content, products and services.\r\n\r\nSegments\r\n\r\nThe company operates through four business segments: Gaming, Lottery, Social, and Digital.\r\n\r\nGaming segment\r\n\r\nThis segment designs, develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a portfolio of gaming products and services. The company provides its Gaming portfolio of products and services to commercial casinos, Native American casinos, wide-area gaming operators (such as licensed betting offices (LBOs)), arcade and bingo operators in the U.K. and continental Europe, and government agencies and their affiliated operators. The company’s equity investments in Roberts Communications Network, LLC and International Terminal Leasing are part of its Gaming business segment.\r\n\r\nGaming Operations\r\n\r\nThe company categorizes its Participation gaming machines as wide-area progressive (WAP), premium and daily fee Participation games; and other leased and Participation games.\r\n\r\nWAP, Premium and Daily Fee Participation Games\r\n\r\nWAP Participation Games: WAP Participation games are electronically linked gaming machines that are located across multiple casinos within a single gaming jurisdiction or across Native American gaming jurisdictions. Players across linked gaming machines contribute to and compete for system-wide progressive jackpots that are designed to increase gaming machine play for participating casinos by giving the players the opportunity to win a larger jackpot than on a non-WAP gaming machine. The company is responsible for funding WAP jackpots. The company creates WAP games using its proprietary brands and also using licensed brands. The company operates its WAP systems in six states throughout the U.S. and in certain Native American casinos.\r\n\r\nPremium and Daily Fee Participation Games: The company offers two categories of non-WAP premium and daily fee Participation games, such as local-area progressive (LAP) and standalone. LAP games are gaming machines that are located within a single casino and are electronically linked to a progressive jackpot for that specific casino. The company’s LAP gaming machines feature games, including those offered as WAP and its proprietary brands, such as Ultimate Fire Link, Dragon Spin, Jackpot Party Progressive, 88 Fortunes, 5 Treasures, and Cash Spin.\r\n\r\nThe company’s LAP products leverage both exclusive brand names and game play intellectual property, and offer players the chance to win multiple progressive jackpots, all of which tend to result in higher play volumes. The company also provides certain standalone Participation games that are not linked to other gaming machines. Its standalone games feature titles under both licensed brands and its proprietary brands.\r\n\r\nOther Leased and Participation Games\r\n\r\nServer-based Gaming: The company provides wide-area gaming operators, such as LBOs, bingo halls and arcades, a package of server-based products and services under long term contracts that include gaming machines, remote management of game content and management information, central computer systems, secure data communication and field support services. The company’s business in this category is primarily based in the U.K.\r\n\r\nVideo Lottery Terminals (VLTs): For certain customers, the company provides its multi-game and single-game VLTs, which include video gaming machines, mechanical reel gaming machines and video poker games. The company’s VLTs might be operated as standalone units or might interface with central monitoring systems operated by government agencies. The company’s VLTs are located in places where casino-style gaming is not the only attraction, such as racetracks, bars and restaurants.\r\n\r\nClass II and Centrally Determined Systems: The company offers video and mechanical-reel gaming machines and VLTs for Class II and certain VLT jurisdictions where the game outcome is determined by a central server system that the company provides. These Class II and centrally determined systems primarily operate in Native American casinos in Washington, Florida, Alabama and Oklahoma. The company receives either a fixed daily fee or a percentage of the Net win generated by the gaming machines or VLTs connected to the central determination system and a small daily fee for the central determination system.\r\n\r\nGaming Machine Sales\r\n\r\nThe majority of the company’s product sales are derived from the sale of gaming machines and VLTs that use a combination of advanced graphics, mechanical reels, digital music and sounds and secondary bonus games. The company also sells electronic table systems to either meet the needs of particular locations where live tables are not allowed or as productivity-improving solutions for other jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nGaming Systems\r\n\r\nThe company’s suite of technology solutions provides gaming operations of every size with a range of marketing, data management and analysis, accounting, player tracking, security and other applications and tools to manage their operations. Gaming systems products include the iVIEW touch screen display, which facilitates the player experience, bonus features, customer service, and employee functions. Gaming systems revenues related to core system solutions are dependent on new installations. Gaming system revenues are also generated through ongoing hardware and software maintenance services and upgrades.\r\n\r\nTable Products\r\n\r\nThe company’s table product sales are generated primarily from the sale of products designed to improve table game speed, productivity, profitability and security. The company’s product offerings include various models of shufflers (various models of automatic card shufflers, deck checkers and roulette chip sorters) to suit specific games.\r\n\r\nThe company also offers shuffler products under month-to-month arrangements that contain Participation rates or fixed monthly rates. These arrangements include service of the product with back-up and replacement products available at the customer’s request.\r\n\r\nThe company licenses its proprietary table game (PTG) content to commercial, tribal and governmental casino operators under month to month arrangements based on fixed monthly rates. PTGs, which are designed to improve operators’ table-game operations, include its internally developed and acquired PTGs, side bets, add-ons and progressive features. The company’s proprietary content and features are also added to public domain games, such as poker, baccarat, pai gow poker, craps and blackjack table games and to electronic platforms.\r\n\r\nThe company’s products are installed in all of the major regulated U.S. gaming jurisdictions, and in approximately 179 international gaming jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nA major portion of the company’s U.K. gaming business benefits from a contract with the primary U.K. bookmaker Ladbrokes Coral Group (a subsidiary of GVC Holdings PLC), which represents a major portion of the company’s U.K. LBO server-based gaming business.\r\n\r\nCompetition\r\n\r\nThe company competes primarily with Ainsworth Game Technology; Aristocrat Leisure Ltd.

The company delivers critical media and marketing information, analytics and manufacturer and retailer expertise about what and where consumers buy (referred to herein as ‘Buy’); and what consumers read, watch and listen to (consumer interaction across the television, radio, print, online, digital, mobile viewing and listening platforms referred to herein as ‘Watch’) on a local and international basis.\r\n\r\nThe company has a presence in approximately 100 countries. Its major ten clients include NBC Universal/ Comcast Corporation, The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle S.A., The Procter & Gamble Company, Twenty-First Century Fox, and the Unilever Group.\r\n\r\nSegments\r\n\r\nThe company operates through two segments, Buy (consumer purchasing measurement and analytics) and Watch (media audience measurement and analytics).\r\n\r\nBuy\r\n\r\nThis segment provides retail transactional measurement data, consumer behavior information and analytics primarily to businesses in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry. The company tracks various sales transactions per month in retail outlets worldwide and its data is used to measure their sales and market share.\r\n\r\nThe company’s Buy services also enable its clients to manage their brands, uncover new sources of demand, manage their supply chain issues, launch and improve new services, analyze their sales, drive merchandising efficiency and effectiveness in-store and improve their marketing mix and establish consumer relationships. Within its Buy segment, the company has two primary geographic groups, developed and emerging markets. Developed markets primarily include the United States (U.S.), Canada, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea and Australia while emerging markets primarily include Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia, China, India and Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nWatch\r\n\r\nThis segment provides viewership and listening data and analytics primarily to the media and advertising industries across the television, radio, print, online, digital, mobile viewing and listening platforms. The company’s Watch data is used by its media clients to understand their audiences, establish the value of their advertising inventory and maximize the value of their content and by its advertising clients to plan, transact, and optimize their media spending.\r\n\r\nIn the company’s Watch segment, its ratings are the primary metrics used to determine the value of programming and advertising in the U.S. television advertising marketplace. In addition to the U.S., the company’s technology is used to measure television viewing in 30 other countries. The company also measures markets that account for approximately 70% of worldwide TV ad spend and offers measurement and analytic services in 60 countries, including the U.S.\r\n\r\nServices and Solutions\r\n\r\nRetail Measurement Services\r\n\r\nThe company provides retail measurement services worldwide. Its retail sales data provides market share, competitive sales volumes, and insights into such activities as distribution, pricing, merchandising and promotion. By combining this detailed information with the company’s expertise (including data science methodologies and granular product and location reference data) and professional consultative services, the company produces valuable insights that help its clients improve their manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sales decisions and improve their market share.\r\n\r\nThe company collects retail sales information from stores using electronic point-of-sale technology and/or teams of local field auditors. Stores within its worldwide retail network include grocery, drug, convenience, discount, some wholesalers, specialty and e-commerce retailers, who, through various cooperation arrangements, share their sales data with the company. The electronic retail sales information collected by stores through checkout scanners is transmitted directly to the company. In certain emerging markets where electronic retail sales information is unavailable, the company utilizes field auditors to collect information through in-store inventory and price checks.\r\n\r\nFor e-commerce retailers where electronic retail sales information is unavailable, the company is using consumer sourced data to collect information by leveraging expertise developed in its Consumer Panel business. For all information that the company collects, its quality control systems validate and confirm the source data. The data is then processed into databases that clients access using the company’s proprietary software that allows them to query the information, conduct customized analysis, and generate reports and alerts.\r\n\r\nConsumer Panel Measurement\r\n\r\nThe company maintains consumer panels worldwide that help its clients understand consumer purchasing dynamics at the household level. Among other things, this information offers insight into shopper behavior, such as trial and repeat purchase for new products, brand or retailer loyalty, and customer segmentation. In addition, the company’s panel data augments its retail measurement information, providing blinded but detailed household demographics and could provide data in circumstances where the company does not collect data from certain retailers.\r\n\r\nThe company’s consumer panels collect data from approximately 250,000 household panelists across 25 countries, using a combination of in-home scanners and a mobile application to record purchases from each shopping trip.\r\n\r\nAnalytical Services\r\n\r\nUtilizing the company’s foundation of consumer purchasing information, the company provides a selection of consumer intelligence and analytical services that help clients make smarter business decisions throughout their product development and marketing cycles. The company draws actionable insights from its retail and consumer panel measurement data sets, its online behavioral information, and various other proprietary data sets.\r\n\r\nThe company uses consumer trends and data analysis to advise its clients across their innovation process and apply a demand-driven approach to identify unmet consumer needs so they could develop products. The company uses intelligence from retail and consumer data analysis to inform client decisions on marketing spend for media, price, promotion and assortment. The company helps clients influence purchase decisions that shoppers make whether pre-store, in-store or online; and provides insights on how to market along a shopper’s path to purchase.\r\n\r\nWhat Consumers Watch\r\n\r\nThe company’s Watch segment provides viewership and listening data and analytics primarily to the media and advertising industries across the television, radio, print, online, digital and mobile viewing and listening platforms.\r\n\r\nThe company has aligned its Watch solutions across the key activities of Planning, Activation, Audience Measurement, and Advertising Effectiveness.\r\n\r\nPlanning\r\n\r\nThe company has a portfolio of solutions that enable clients to create optimized media plans to reach their desired audiences.\r\n\r\nNielsen Ad Intel provides advertising intelligence across traditional and digital media in 29 markets worldwide and could provide information for approximately 80 markets worldwide.

Beyond demonstrating audience targeting, value and media planning, qualitative information provides advertiser insights into the areas of promotions, marketing, brand management, multiculturalism, product development, shopper insights and sponsorship.\r\n\r\nThe company provides syndicated local qualitative measurement in 151 U.S. markets, as well as Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nActivation\r\n\r\nThe company offers approximately 60,000 segments representing different demographics, psychographics, media consumption and buying behavior. From top funnel insights, describing demographics, economic and job related parameters, to mid funnel insights describing content that viewers have expressed interest in, such as TV shows watched, restaurants dined at, stores shopped, etc. to insights on expressed intent. These audiences describe individuals with high propensity of exhibiting future behaviors, such as purchasing a specific car model, a financial product, airline tickets, and more.\r\n\r\nThe company enables these segments in an array of buying platforms connected to the company’s data management platform (DMP). The Nielsen Marketing Cloud is its platform for the custom creation of audiences and activation of those audiences for campaign delivery. The Nielsen Marketing Cloud empowers brands, agencies and media companies to connect with customers by combining the company’s data, analytics, media planning, marketing activation and DMP capabilities in a single cloud platform.\r\n\r\nThe company’s clients could connect directly to its Nielsen Marketing Cloud to identify desired syndicated targeting or created custom targets using their own first party data, unlocking the target combinations and using its insights as analytics and ROI tools. Nielsen Marketing Cloud clients gain access to granular Nielsen data, which powers audience insights at a much higher degree of detail than is available anywhere else.

      "description": "TripAdvisor, Inc., through its subsidiaries, operates as an online travel company worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe company provides consumers and travel partners a platform with consumer-generated content, price comparison tools and online reservation and related services for destinations, accommodations, travel activities and experiences, and restaurants. The company owns and operates a portfolio of online travel brands.\r\n\r\nThe company’s TripAdvisor-branded Websites include www.tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the TripAdvisor Website in 48 markets and 28 languages worldwide. TripAdvisor features approximately 730 million reviews and opinions on approximately 8.1 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do, including 1.3 million hotels, inns, B&Bs and specialty lodging, 875,000 rental properties, 4.9 million restaurants and 1.0 million travel activities and experiences worldwide. The company also enables consumers to compare prices and/or book these travel experiences on either a TripAdvisor Website or mobile application (app), or on the Website or mobile app of one of its travel partners.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the primary TripAdvisor brand, the company manages and operates the following other travel media brands, connected by the common intention of providing consumers the travel-planning and trip-taking resource, such as www.airfarewatchdog.com, www.bokun.io, www.bookingbuddy.com, www.cruisecritic.com, www.familyvacationcritic.com, www.flipkey.com, www.thefork.com (www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, and www.iens.nl), www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.holidaywatchdog.com, www.housetrip.com, www.jetsetter.com, www.niumba.com, www.onetime.com, www.oyster.com, www.seatguru.com, www.smartertravel.com, www.tingo.com, www.vacationhomerentals.com, and www.viator.com.\r\n\r\nSegments\r\n\r\nThe company operates through two segments, Hotel and Non-Hotel.\r\n\r\nHotel segment\r\n\r\nThis segment generates revenue from the following sources:\r\n\r\nTripAdvisor-branded Click-based and Transaction Revenue: The company’s major source of Hotel segment revenue is generated from click-based advertising on TripAdvisor-branded Websites, which primarily includes contextually-relevant links to its travel partners’ sites. The company’s click-based travel partners are primarily online travel agencies (OTAs) and direct suppliers in the hotel category.\r\n\r\nTripAdvisor-branded Display-based Advertising and Subscription Revenue: Travel partners could promote their brands through various display-based advertising placements on its Websites. The company’s display-based advertising clients are primarily direct suppliers of hotels, air travel and cruises, as well as destination marketing organizations. Other display clients include OTAs and other travel-related businesses, as well as advertisers from non-travel categories. Display-based advertising is sold primarily on a cost per thousand impressions basis. The company also offers subscription-based advertising to hoteliers, owners of B&Bs and other specialty lodging properties, enabling subscribers to advertise their businesses on its Website, as well as manage and promote their Website URL, email address, phone number, special offers and other information related to their business. Subscription advertising services are primarily sold for a flat fee for a contracted period of time of approximately one year.\r\n\r\nOther Hotel Revenue: The company’s other Hotel revenue primarily includes revenue from non-TripAdvisor-branded Websites, such as www.bookingbuddy.com, www.cruisecritic.com, www.onetime.com, and www.smartertravel.com, which primarily includes click-based advertising and display-based advertising revenue sources.\r\n\r\nNon-Hotel segment\r\n\r\nThis segment consists of the company’s Experiences, Restaurants and Rentals offerings\r\n\r\nExperiences: The company provides information and services for consumers to research, book and travel activities and experiences in popular travel destinations both through Viator, its Experiences offering, and on its TripAdvisor Website and app. The company also powers travel activities and experience booking capabilities to consumers on affiliate partner Websites, including major airlines, hotel chains and online and offline travel agencies. The company works with local tour or travel activities/experiences operators (the supplier) to provide consumers with access to tours, activities and experiences (the activity) in major destinations worldwide. The company generates commissions for each booking transaction it facilitates through its online reservation system. To a lesser extent, the company earns commissions from third-party merchant partners, which display and promote its supplier activities on their Websites to generate bookings.\r\n\r\nRestaurants: The company provides information and services for consumers to research and book restaurants in popular travel destinations through its restaurant reservations offering, TheFork, and on its TripAdvisor Websites and mobile apps. TheFork is an online restaurant booking platform operating on various Websites www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, and www.iens.nl), with a network of restaurant partners located primarily across Europe and Australia. The company’s bookable restaurants are available on www.thefork.com and on TripAdvisor-branded Websites and mobile apps. The company primarily generates transaction fees (or per seated diner fees) that are paid by restaurants for diners seated primarily from bookings through TheFork’s online reservation system. The company also generates subscription fees for subscription-based advertising to restaurants, access to certain online reservation management services and marketing analytic tools provided by TheFork and TripAdvisor.\r\n\r\nRentals: The company provides information and services for consumers to research and book vacation and short-term rental properties, including home rentals, condominiums, villas, beach rentals, cabins and cottages. The company’s Rentals offering generates revenue primarily by offering individual property owners and managers the ability to list their properties on its Websites and mobile apps thereby connecting homeowners with travelers through a free-to-list, commission-based option or by an annual subscription-based fee structure. These properties are listed on www.flipkey.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.housetrip.com, www.niumba.com, www.vacationhomerentals.com, and on its TripAdvisor-branded Websites and mobile apps.\r\n\r\nConsumer Offerings\r\n\r\nThe company enables consumers to plan, book and experience the perfect trip by providing content, supply, price, and convenience.\r\n\r\nTravel Partners\r\n\r\nThe company’s portfolio of travel-related Websites enables its travel partners to be discovered, to advertise and to sell their services to a travel audience worldwide. Travel partners might include hotel chains, independent hoteliers, OTAs, destination marketing organizations, and other travel-related and non-travel related product and service providers—who seek to market and sell their products and services to audience worldwide. The company enables media advertising opportunities – and in some cases, facilitates transactions between consumers and travel partners in various ways, including by sending referrals to its travel partners’ Websites, facilitating bookings on behalf of its travel partners, by serving as the merchant of record – particularly in its Experiences and Rentals offerings – and by offering advertising placements on its Websites and mobile apps.\r\n\r\nStrategy\r\n\r\nThe company’s strategy includes driving consumer engagement with its platform; delivering the best user experience possible on its platform; deepening relationships with its travel partners; and investing in technology and product.\r\n\r\nCommercial Relationships\r\n\r\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the company’s two major partners were Expedia Group, Inc. (Expedia) and Booking Holdings Inc. (Booking).\r\n\r\nGovernment Regulation\r\n\r\nIn the company’s processing of reservations, it receives and stores a large volume of personally identifiable data in the United States, Europe, and Asia. This data is subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions worldwide, including the European Union through the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation.\r\n\r\nSeasonality\r\n\r\nThe company’s financial performance tends to be seasonally highest in the second and third quarters (year ended December 31, 2018) of a year, as it is a key period for leisure travel research and trip-taking, which includes the seasonal peak in traveler hotel and rental stays, and travel activities and experiences taken, compared to the first and fourth quarters, which represent seasonal low points\r\n\r\nCompetition\r\n\r\nIn its Hotel segment, the company faces competition from, and in some cases partner with Expedia andBookin; hotel metasearch providers, including trivago, a subsidiary of Expedia, Kayak and HotelsCombined, subsidiaries of Booking, and Ctrip.com International, Ltd; and large online search, social media, and marketplace platforms and companies, such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft’s Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Alibaba, and Amazon.\r\n\r\nIn its Non-Hotel segment, Experiences competes with online travel agencies, such as Airbnb, Booking, and GetYourGuide; traditional travel agencies; online travel service providers; and wholesalers, among others. The company’s Restaurants offering competes with other online restaurant reservation services, such as SeatMe (owned by Yelp) and OpenTable (a subsidiary of Booking), and local or regional providers. The company’s Rentals offering competes with companies focused on alternative lodging and shared accommodations and online accommodation searches, including Airbnb, HomeAway (a subsidiary of Expedia) and Booking.com (a subsidiary of Booking).\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nTripAdvisor, Inc. was founded in 2000 by Stephen Kaufer.",

      "description": "LiveRamp Holdings, Inc. operates as a technology and enablement services company worldwide. The company operates through three segments: Connectivity, Audience Solutions, and Marketing Services.\r\n\r\nConnectivity\r\n\r\nThis segment enables the company’s clients to build an omni-channel view of the customer and activate that understanding across the marketing ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe company, through integrations with approximately 575 major digital marketing platforms and data providers, it has a key point of entry into the digital ecosystem, helping its clients eliminate data silos and unlock value from the marketing tools they use every day. The company provides a foundational identity resolution layer enabling its clients to identify and reach consumers across channels and measure the impact of marketing on sales, using the marketing platform of their choice.\r\n\r\nThe company’s primary Connectivity offering is LiveRamp IdentityLink, an identity resolution service that ties data back to real people and makes it possible to onboard that data for people-based marketing initiatives across digital channels. Leveraging AbiliTec and the LiveRamp identity graph, IdentityLink first resolves a client’s first-, second-, and third-party, exposure, and transaction data to persistent anonymous consumer identifiers that represent real people in a privacy-safe way. This omni-channel view of the consumer could then be onboarded to and between any of the 575 plus partners in the company’s ecosystem to support targeting, personalization and measurement use cases.\r\n\r\nIdentityLink operates in an Acxiom SafeHaven certified environment with technical, operational, and personnel controls designed to ensure the company’s clients’ data is kept private and secure.\r\n\r\nIdentityLink is sold to brands and the companies brands partner to execute their marketing, including marketing technology providers, data providers, publishers, and agencies.\r\n\r\nIdentityLink for Brands and Agencies: IdentityLink allows brands and their agencies to execute people-based marketing by creating an omni-channel understanding of the consumer and activating that understanding across their choice of best-of-breed digital marketing platforms.\r\n\r\nIdentityLink for Marketing Technology Providers: IdentityLink provides marketing technology providers with the ability to offer people-based targeting, measurement and personalization within their platforms.

Data could be distributed to clients or made available through the IdentityLink Data Store feature. This adds value for brands as it allows them to augment their understanding of consumers, and increase both their reach against and understanding of customers and prospects.\r\n\r\nIdentityLink for Publishers: IdentityLink allows publishers to offer people-based marketing on their properties. This adds value for brands by providing direct access to their customers and prospects in the publisher’s premium inventory.\r\n\r\nAudience Solutions\r\n\r\nThis segment helps clients validate the accuracy of their data, improve it with additional insight, and keep it up to date, enabling clients to reach desired audiences with relevant messages. Leveraging the company’s recognition and data assets, clients could identify, segment, and differentiate their audiences for marketing and customer experiences. Audience Solutions’ offerings include InfoBase, the company’s major consumer data store that serves as the basis for its consumer demographics products; and AbiliTec, the company’s patented identity resolution technology that assists its clients in reconciling and managing variations of customer identity over time and across multiple channels.\r\n\r\nInfoBase: With approximately 1,500 demographic, socio-economic and lifestyle data elements and various predictive models, the company’s InfoBase products provide marketers with the ability to identify and reach the right audience with the right message across both traditional and digital channels. Through partnerships with approximately 100 online publishers and digital marketing platforms, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, 4INFO, AOL, eBay and MSN, marketers could use InfoBase data to create and target specific audiences. Data could be accessed directly or through the Acxiom Audience Cloud, a Web-based, self-service tool that build and distribute third-party custom data segments.\r\n\r\nAbiliTec: AbiliTec helps brands recognize individuals and households using different input variables and connect identities online and offline.\r\n\r\nBy identifying and linking multiple identifiers and data elements back to a persistent ID, the company’s clients are able to create a single view of the customer, which allows them to perform audience targeting and deliver customer experiences.\r\n\r\nMarketing Services\r\n\r\nThis segment helps clients unify data at the individual level in a privacy-safe environment, so they could execute people-based marketing campaigns, tie back to real results, and drive a continual cycle of optimization. The company helps architect the foundation for data-driven marketing by delivering solutions that integrate customer and prospect data across the enterprise, thereby enabling its clients to establish a single view of the customer. The company also supports its clients in navigating the complexities of consumer privacy regulation.\r\n\r\nMarketing Database Services: The company’s marketing database offering provides solutions that unify consumer data across an enterprise, enabling clients to execute relevant, people-based marketing and activate data across the marketing ecosystem. The company’s consumer marketing databases, which it designs, builds, and manages for its clients, make it possible for clients to collect and analyze information from various sources. Through its improving partner network, clients are able to integrate their data with best-of-breed marketing solutions while respecting and protecting consumer privacy.\r\n\r\nStrategy and Analytics: The company’s strategy and analytics group includes marketing strategists and data scientists who leverage industry knowledge and advanced analytics to assist its clients with identifying growth opportunities, addressing marketing data and technology needs, and adopting best practices. In addition, the company helps its clients identify and address their data privacy and governance requirements.\r\n\r\nThe company’s products and services form the ‘power grid’ for data, the critical foundation for people-based marketing that brands need to engage consumers across landscape of channels and devices.\r\n\r\nThe company provides integrations with various marketing platforms and data providers in the digital marketing ecosystem, enabling its clients to innovate through their preferred choice of technology, data, and services providers.\r\n\r\nClients\r\n\r\nThe company’s client base primarily consists of Fortune 1000 companies and organizations in the financial services, insurance, information services, direct marketing, retail, consumer packaged goods, technology, automotive, healthcare, travel, and communications industries, as well as in non-profit and government sectors.\r\n\r\nSales and Marketing\r\n\r\nThe company’s sales teams focus on new business development across all markets – sales to new clients and sales of new lines of business to existing clients, as well as revenue growth within existing accounts.\r\n\r\nThe company’s partner organization focuses on enabling primary media partners, agencies and software providers who could help drive value for its clients or who benefit from using Acxiom for data, analytics and audience management. The company serves a global client base from locations in the United States, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n\r\nGrowth Strategy\r\n\r\nThe key elements of the company's growth strategy include continuing to innovate and extend leadership position in data connectivity; establishing the standard for recognition and user identification in the marketing ecosystem; continuing to grow its client base and expanding existing client relationships; expanding global presence; and building an enduring business.\r\n\r\nResearch and Development\r\n\r\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, the company’s research and development expense was $94.9 million.\r\n\r\nSeasonality\r\n\r\nThe company’s traditional direct marketing operations experience their lowest revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year (year ended March 2018), with higher revenue in the second, third, and fourth quarters. To minimize the impact of these fluctuations, the company continues to seek long-term arrangements with more predictable revenues.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nThe comany, a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1969. It was formerly known as Acxiom Holdings, Inc. and changed its name to LiveRamp Holdings, Inc. in October 2018.",
