      "content": "Liboro criticized the company over the issue, saying the storage of passwords in plain text needlessly exposed people to risk.<br><br>“Passwords that are stored in plain text are more easily and readily stolen by those who intend harm; they may even be compromised by accident,” Liboro said.<br><br>“Even if there is no evidence of abuse, there is little comfort in knowing that the world’s largest repository of personal data practices such lax internal controls. In a 2018 study, the Ponemon Institute (a global information security think tank) found that 60 percent of businesses indicated that their data breaches come from negligent employees or contractors,” he added.<br><br>Liboro urged those affected to change their passwords immediately and enable multi-factor authentication.<br><br>Facebook’s vice president for engineering, security and privacy Pedro Canahuati said they discovered the matter during a routine security review in January.<br><br>“This caught our attention because our login systems are designed to mask passwords using techniques that make them unreadable,” he said.<br><br>“We have fixed these issues and as a precaution we will be notifying everyone whose password we have found were stored in this way,” he added.<br><br>Canahuati maintained the passwords were never visible to anyone outside of the company and that they have found no evidence that anyone internally abused or improperly accessed them.<br><br>Nevertheless, they will still notify “hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users, tens of millions of other Facebook users and tens of thousands of Instagram users” whose passwords were stored in the said format, he said.<br><br>Canahuati recommended users should take precautions to secure their accounts, including changing their passwords.<br><br>He recommended avoiding reusing passwords across different services and picking strong and complex passwords with the help of password manager applications.<br><br>“Consider enabling a security key or two-factor authentication to protect your Facebook account using codes from a third-party authentication app,” he said.<br><br>“When you log in with your password, we will ask for a security code or to tap your security key to verify that it is you,” he added.<br><br>The Facebook official maintained there is nothing more important to them than protecting user information, vowing to continue making improvements as part of their ongoing security efforts.<br><br>“In line with security best practices, Facebook masks people’s passwords when they create an account so that no one at the company can see them,” he said.<br><br>Canahuati added they have various security measures in place to help protect people’s accounts.<br><br>Among these measures are the use of signals to detect suspicious activities on accounts, as well as a system that enables users to register a physical security key to an account.<br><br>“Knowing some people reuse passwords across different services, we keep a close eye on data breach announcements from other organizations and publicly posted databases of stolen credentials,” Canahuati said.<br><br>“We check if stolen email and password combinations match the same credentials being used on Facebook. If we find a match, we’ll notify you next time you login and guide you through changing your password,” he added.<br><br>Privacy commissioner Raymund Liboro said on Friday he has raised the matter with Arianne Jimenez, Facebook’s privacy and public policy manager for Asia Pacific, who maintained that the data were not internally abused or improperly accessed.",

Some people become richer or poorer within days of publication. For example, the fortune of Tsuyoshi Matsushita of Japan ($1.3 billion on our list) fell by nearly $600 million by February 18, as shares of his fitness and beauty-products firm, MTG, tumbled. We list individuals rather than multigenerational families who share fortunes, though we include wealth belonging to a billionaire's spouse and children if that person is the founder of the fortune. In some cases we list siblings or couples together if the ownership breakdown among them isn't clear, but here an estimated net worth of $1 billion per person is needed to make the cut. We value a variety of assets, including private companies, real estate, art and more. We don't pretend to know each billionaire's private balance sheet (though some provide it). When documentation isn't supplied or available, we discount fortunes.

Angry Democrats attacked the former Starbucks CEO as potentially dividing the anti-Trump constituency, while others bemoaned yet another billionaire entering politics. Despite being worth $3.5 billion--a sum made up largely of Starbucks shares--Schultz has pushed back against the influence of wealth in politics, saying he should pay more in taxes and vowing to reveal his tax returns if elected. He also said he's willing to spend hundreds of millions of his own money on his campaign.<br><br>NEWCOMER<br><br>Katie Rodan and Kathy Fields<br><br>NET WORTH $1.5 BIL (EACH)<br><br>Dermatologists Rodan (left) and Fields have tapped into the lucrative skin care market with their ­multilevel marketing firm Rodan + Fields, which has $1.5 billion in sales and 300,000 independent \"consultants\" selling antiaging creams and more. In February, they launched a new teen acne line, a throwback to their first claim to fame, acne product Proactiv, whose royalty rights they sold in 2016. In May 2018, private equity firm TPG Capital invested a reported $1 billion for a 25% stake in Rodan + Fields.

      "title": "REIMAGINING CAPITALISM",
      "content": "Sitting in a modest room in New York's ­immodest Peninsula Hotel, the richest person in the world for most of the past 20 years ponders an existential question suddenly in vogue among the left's confiscatory set: Should he even exist? \"It is fascinating,\" says Bill Gates, \"that for the first time in my life, people are saying, 'Okay, should you have billionaires?' \"<br><br>Dispassionately, he begins to unpack that thesis. \"I'm afraid if you really implemented something like that, that the amount you would gain would be much less than the amount you would lose. Now, that sounds self-interested, so who's the neutral witness on this one? … We need somebody who's not wealthy to say that in some cases allowing people to be wealthy is okay.\"<br><br>Allow me to raise my hand. For the past year, I've had one-on-one discussions with no fewer than two dozen billionaires, including face-to-face meetings with the three richest people in the world—Jeff Bezos, Gates and Warren Buffett—touching on various aspects of capitalism's future. It comes at an urgent moment: You'd have to go back to the 1960s, or maybe even the 1930s, to find a time when the primacy of the free market system was so widely questioned.<br><br>Just 56% of Americans say they have a positive image of capitalism, according to a Gallup poll last summer, compared with 37% who said the same thing about socialism. In a Fox News poll during the same period, 36% of adults approved of a shift in the U.S. \"away from capitalism and more toward socialism\"—a huge increase from 2012, when just 20% said so.<br><br>Among Millennials and Gen Z, free market skepticism is actually the majority view. In Gallup's poll, 51% of those 18 to 29 had a positive view of socialism—albeit the largely fuzzy Scandinavian/Bernie Sanders version rather than the Soviet/Berlin Wall hard stuff—compared with 45% for capitalism. That finding was echoed by a Harvard survey of young adults in which 51% said they did not support capitalism and only 19% said they \"identify as a capitalist.\" These sentiments come amid an economy that by all traditional measures is booming, with full employment and 3% growth.<br><br>So far, 2019 has offered only reinforcement of these views, as tech companies have continued to bleed credibility, Howard Schultz turned himself into a cartoon and a slew of tax-the-very-rich proposals garnered surprisingly high support. \"This has been brewing for years, accelerating in the last few months and again in the last few weeks,\" says Steve Case, the AOL founder who now runs an investment firm, Revolution. The hedge fund titan Paul Tudor Jones adds: \"I think we need to acknowledge that we're at a crossroads, with massive social fissures.\"<br><br>And those were just some of the billionaires willing to speak on the record. Virtually everyone I talked to acknowledged the need for change. Some incremental and many systemic; some spoke in whispers, many in full-throated pleas for \"reform\" or \"a reboot.\" The rock star Bono had perhaps the most poetic suggestion: a reimagination .<br><br>If such a term conjures Steve Jobs or Walt Disney, two of capitalism's visionary saints, so be it. Entrepreneurial capitalism remains, objectively, the best system ever invented to create and distribute prosperity, and if you look at the billion-plus people in China, India and elsewhere who were lifted from extreme poverty in the past two decades, it remains easy to sing its praises. The dynamism remains true in the U.S., too. Of The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans, 67% are self-made and 11% are immigrants. \"America works, and it works now better than it ever worked,\" Buffett says.<br><br>Since too many Americans don't feel that way, the time is ripe to reimagine a system that addresses them. Pick the brains of some of the greatest-ever manifestations of the American Dream, and an AAA-version of capitalism<br><br>emerges, one more authentic , accessible and accountable —and perhaps, in an age of uncertainty, one that's built to last. The stakes couldn't be higher, as forces gather to threaten the greatest prosperity engine ever built.<br><br>REIMAGINING CAPITALISM AS ... AUTHENTIC<br><br>the French nobleman Alexis de Tocqueville's travels across America in the 1830s coincided with the emergence of socialist theory back in Europe, a movement he presciently and stridently criticized. For Tocqueville, the balanced capitalism he witnessed compared favorably to the options back home, such as ceding power to the government or a more feudal system \"managed by a few rich and powerful individuals.\" \"The inhabitants of the United States almost always manage to combine their own advantage with that of their fellow citizens,\" he observed. Tocqueville's musings inspired Friedrich Hayek's Road to Serfdom and filtered into the very first issue of Forbes, printed during Russia's Revolution, when the magazine's founder, B.C. Forbes, famously declared that \"business was originated to produce happiness, not to pile up millions.\"<br><br>Milton Friedman was another 20th-century admirer of Tocqueville, particularly for his focus on political equality as a driver of prosperity. But Friedman famously held that among all the constituents of business—the customer, the employees, the community—just one ultimately mattered, the shareholder. The only social responsibility of business, he declared, was to maximize profits. If shareholders wanted to spend their profits on altruistic projects, great, but that was at their sole discretion, with the assumption they were buying something of value—perhaps social approbation or the assuaging of guilt.<br><br>This maxim gave us LBOs, private equity deals and employee buyouts. And to many of the world's most successful capitalists, it also created many of the current ills. \"How wrong I was about Milton Friedman—most of us were,\" says Jones, who built a $5 billion fortune exploiting market opportunities, including shorting the 1987 market crash. \"It came at great cost to other corporate stakeholders and eroded the trust on which companies, and civil society, depends.\"<br><br>In an era when consumers crave authenticity, the Tocque­ville version, which sees profits as a by-product of business rather than its singular mission, offers a natural strain of capitalism that's already hugely popular, especially among younger Americans. For Millennials, according to a massive Deloitte survey in 2018, the bottom three priorities for a business should be profits, efficiency and sales. The top three? Generating jobs, improving society and innovation.<br><br>Authenticity explains why Americans, while disliking Wall Street and big business, continue to love entrepreneurs (87% approval, per Gallup) and small business (96%). And why purpose-driven companies like Patagonia and Warby Parker are wreathed in halos, no matter what they're selling or how rich the founders get.<br><br>\"When we're acquiring companies, one of the things I look at very closely is 'Are the founders of a company missionaries or mercenaries?' \" Jeff Bezos told me several months ago, before revealing the answer with his famous braying laugh. \"It's actually very easy to tell—missionaries make better products and ser­vices.\" They also engender the one authentic trait that's ultimately the most profitable: trust. That word, says Bezos, \"is what allows you to expand the business.\"<br><br>Of course, trust is a double-edged sword. As Facebook treats user data as a chit rather than a covenant, the company's reputation—and Zuckerberg's—has tanked. (In the realm of extremely unlikely outcomes, it's now easier to envision him in the Big House than in the White House.) It's also why Wall Street remains about as popular as big tobacco.<br><br>But even in finance, roots of authenticity shoot up. Impact investing, long dismissed as a niche for do-gooders, has emerged as a growth area, with some $35 billion committed in 2018 to fund businesses that carry societal benefits without sacrificing returns. \"We're talking about solving problems using innovation and entrepreneurship,\" says Nancy Pfund, who founded DBL Partners and has raised $625 million in three venture funds. Her flagship, with investments in Tesla and SolarCity, has ranked in the top performance quartile across this decade. \"When you just look at the super-short-term shareholder, you're not taking advantage of innovation—and you're cheating the future.\"<br><br>The numbers are getting larger: Breakthrough Energy Ventures, backed by a consortium of billionaires such as Gates, Bezos, Michael Bloomberg, Richard Branson and Jack Ma, has pledged $1 billion for startups that promise radical solutions to carbon emissions. A similarly platinum-plated tycoon cohort, including Bono, Laurene Powell Jobs and Jeff Skoll, has backed the Rise Fund, an arm of private equity giant TPG that has deployed $1.8 billion in 25 investments they think will have significant impact on society. \"People are rightfully asking, 'Is the system working?' \" says Bill McGlashan, the CEO of the Rise Fund. \"We believe that capitalism is a better servant than master.\"<br><br>REIMAGINING CAPITALISM AS ... ACCESSIBLE<br><br>For those who rightly still believe in America as the land of opportunity, a Fox News survey from just a few weeks ago should offer pause: 42% of Americans do not think \"the way capitalism works in the U.S. these days\" gives them \"a fair shot.\" Even more troubling: In a country that has always held true to the premise that you could make it through hard work—or at least your children could—18% thought that the American Dream is out of reach for their family.<br><br>And there are ample stats to back up the sentiment. In the U.S. the top 1% of workers, collectively, earn vastly more than the bottom 50%. \"The market system as it gets more specialized pushes more money to the top,\" Buffett explains. \"The natural function of a more specialized market economy is to divert more and more of the rewards to the top. That's something I don't think we've fully addressed in this country.\"<br><br>But the situation is actually far worse than yawning income disparity. Americans have historically viewed the superrich as heroes, not villains, for a simple reason: \"We all thought we could be like them,\" Jones says. It's the accelerating lack of upward mobility that's fueling much of this populist anger. For all the anecdotal success stories, if you're born in the wrong Zip code, to the wrong parents, the road to The Forbes 400 has never looked longer or narrower.<br><br>Take venture capital, the clearest starting point to a billion-dollar fortune over the past 20 years—a door the vast majority of Americans have no way of opening. Just 15% of VC money goes to women founders, 1% to black entrepreneurs and less than a quarter to anyone who lives outside California, New York and Massachusetts. Yes, a far more global, diverse pool now has access to those funding meccas, but that's little comfort to a parent whose kid goes to a so-so public school in a city or region that's been left behind.<br><br>\"It needs to be a national priority to level the playing field,\" says Case, who for the past few years has conducted a Rise of the Rest bus tour, traveling the country and putting millions into more than 100 companies that aren't in Boston, New York or the San Francisco Bay Area. To Case, it's both civic duty and opportunity, as brilliant minds lie fallow in low-cost areas desperate for high-growth hope.<br><br>Pfund actually counts women leaders before investing in a firm—almost two thirds of the companies in her funds have a woman at the CFO level or higher. She also pushes her portfolio to spread the opportunity, through profit-sharing plans, living-wage commitments and encouragement to hire in underserved areas.<br><br>All these efforts are on the margin, short of a commitment to create educational opportunities for those with ambition and then a track for them going forward. \"We will have the resources,\" Buffett says. \"The question is, will we in effect pull everybody in who's able-bodied and willing to work 40 hours a week so they can make a decent living, raise a family?\"<br><br>REIMAGINING CAPITALISM AS ... ACCOUNTABLE<br><br>Something unusual happened a few hours after my sit-down with Bill Gates. Fresh off pondering the future of billionaires, he went on Stephen Colbert's eponymous show with his wife, Melinda, to a crescendo of cheers. In accepting his new role as the world's second-richest person, he quipped, \"We're trying to give it away faster\"—and the audience swooned. From their call for higher taxes on the superrich to the obligations of the successful to the empowerment of women, the applause kept coming. By the end, Colbert was playfully goading the Gateses to run for political office.<br><br>Compare that with the Bronx cheer that echoed through New York later that week, when Amazon announced it was pulling out from its HQ2 plan in Queens. The math-challenged politicians who killed the deal took justifiable heat from pretty much everyone except their base. But Bezos was bloodied just as badly. He's worth over $130 billion (at least until his divorce settles), and Amazon is worth $800 billion. Why extract a measly $3 billion in corporate welfare from New York? In the truest Friedman sense: because he has shareholders—and he could.<br><br>The dueling reactions underscore an American truth as timeless as Astor and Cooper and Rockefeller: Americans expect their meritocratic royalty to remain accountable to the public that helped create them.<br><br>Traditionally, that means philanthropy, an aspect of extreme success (there are now 137 deca-billionaires in the world) that no longer feels optional, albeit one that still engenders cynicism. Says Gates: \"The attack that 'Why should you even have a say in setting the agenda?' That has a certain resonance to it.\"<br><br>For Gates, who within our lifetime will likely be regarded as the greatest philanthropist ever, accountability starts with framing the role: \"picking novel ideas\" or \"off-the-wall theories,\" as he says, and then proving that the concepts work, or don't, taking the kinds of risks that no taxpayer-funded government—or shareholder-dependent corporation—could justify.<br><br>But in this era, Gates also recognizes that motives will be questioned. \"If we come and improve math class,\" Gates says, \"then people are like, 'Hey, you didn't do the band.' \" For this reason, Gates tries to hold himself publicly accountable through transparency, including a public letter from the foundation that he and Melinda write each year. It's also the driving reason for the Giving Pledge, in which 189 of the world's wealthiest people have affirmed, for all to see, that they will give away at least half of their fortunes, most much more.<br><br>A Giving Pledge signatory, Salesforce founder Marc Ben­i­off has similarly shifted from anonymous giving to putting his name on two hospitals, in part to be a role model for emerging tech billionaires and in part because \"it sent a message that we're supporting the community in a tangible way.\" And he does the same thing with his company, which pioneered a<br><br>\"1, 1, 1\" model that placed 1% of the company's equity in a trust, along with a pledge to donate 1% of its software products and 1% of his 35,000 employees' time to volunteer work. It's a combination that's generated $260 million in grants and 3.8 million hours for civic causes.<br><br>Rather than rely on such voluntary munificence, Jones, who cut his philanthropic teeth founding the innovative Robin Hood Foundation in New York, has focused for the past several years on holding corporate America directly accountable for better capitalism. He founded Just Capital, which has surveyed more than 80,000 Americans in order to get a precisely calibrated take on what makes a good corporate citizen. America's older workers, it turns out, aren't so different from its youngest, desiring companies to pay and treat their employees well, put out good products that have integrity, and care about the environment and the community.<br><br>Just Capital ranks every major public company across its 36 criteria, from best to worst, proffering a Good Housekeeping-like seal to the top companies, in order to spur better corporate citizenry. (Disclosure: I'm on the Just Capital board, and Forbes publishes the annual Just 100 list each fall.) \"You can't manage what you can't measure,\" says Jones, who also helped Just launch a $200 million ETF in June 2018 that has so far outperformed the S&P 500.<br><br>Measurement has also been driving McGlashan at the Rise Fund, which has a hard time justifying billions in investments in social good when no one can define what \"good\" is. To that end, Rise incubated and then recently spun out Y Analytics, a firm devoted to measuring this impact—a key step in making capitalism still more solutions-oriented.<br><br>Such remedies are urgent. \"Unless we find a market-based solution to the exponential growth in inequality, we will end up with populist legislation that creates a hammer to go after every nail,\" Jones says. He's right. Alexandria Ocasio-­Cortez's much-touted 70% income tax bracket displays a stark lack of understanding how fortunes in this country are built—through ownership, not earnings. Elizabeth Warren's wealth surcharge would require an army of appraisers. \"Here's the problem with all of those,\" says the venture capitalist Vinod Khosla. \"There is international mobility.\"<br><br>Virtually every billionaire I spoke with acknowledged that higher taxes on the billionaire set are inevitable; most even saw them as beneficial, if correctly applied. According to Gates, Buffett, Khosla and others, the correct way to levy taxes on the superrich is at a transaction point. Either an estate tax without the loopholes that currently render it useless or a higher capital gains tax applied only on extreme fortunes, to avoid suppressing growth.<br><br>And better yet, the tax code can be refined to encourage growth and spread it around more evenly. The launch of opportunity zones, engineered by the Facebook and Spotify billionaire Sean Parker, has already been put in motion, offering tantalizing tax breaks in needy areas of all 50 states. Adjusting corporate tax rates based on jobs created—more jobs, lower taxes—is another worthy idea.<br><br>The eternal beauty of the free market is its ability to evolve. Leave it to the most admired capitalist in the world, Warren Buffett, who has lived through more than one third of this country's history and who bought his first stock in 1942, at a moment when it was conceivable the U.S. could lose World War II, to make a prediction: \"The luckiest person that will ever be born in the world to date will be a baby being born in the United States today.\" Bet against Buffett, and capitalism, at your peril.",

''Also in humans, I think, you cannot separate the two. You can barely think without emotions, and you can barely have emotions if there's not some cognition involved.'' He explained, ''Emotions are bodily states. When you get emotional, your heart rate goes up, your blood pressure increases. ... These changes are very much the same in humans and animals. For example, we say we get 'cold feet' when we're afraid, and that's literally true, we've tested it. It's true for rats, too -- they get cold feet, and their tails get cold, when they are scared. What fear does is draw the blood from the extremities.''<br><br>De Waal says that ''animals that are close to us,'' like apes, express emotions the way we do.

      "title": "CHEAP THRILLS",
      "content": "\"Forty-one percent of U.S. households don't have $400 worth of liquidity,\" Szulczewski says, referring to the Fed's latest estimate. He says customers of his ultra-bargain shopping site have their credit cards declined most often right before payday, rattling off statistics as he easily mounts another flight of stairs, his legs conditioned by decades of weight lifting (he says it helps him relax). The 37-year-old Polish-born former Google engineer is obsessed with ordinary folks' finances and has used that obsession to tailor an e-commerce marketplace just for them, filled with no-name merchandise shipped directly from Chinese merchants.<br><br>Wish was the most downloaded shopping app worldwide in 2018 and is now the third-biggest e-commerce marketplace in the U.S. by sales . Globally, some 90 million people use it at least once a month. Taking a 15% cut of their purchases, Wish doubled its revenue last year, to $1.9 billion. As of its last fund­raising round, it was valued at more than $8.7 billion, and Szulczewski's 18% stake makes him a billionaire. (His cofounder, Danny Zhang, owns just 4.2%.) Szulczewski says investors should expect an IPO in the next year or two.<br><br>Wish is hardly the first e-commerce app to track every customer click—Amazon built a $200 billion annual sales colossus on precisely this sort of data. And Wish is competing with both Alibaba's AliExpress and Amazon in offering shoppers a never-ending stream of Chinese-made items from third-party sellers. But while Amazon keeps adding features like streaming video and two-hour delivery to yoke customers to its Prime membership service, Szulczewski (pronounced sull-CHESS-key) doesn't worry much about quick delivery or quality. Wish sweaters cost $2 plus $2 shipping, Apple Watch knockoffs go for $9 (plus $3 shipping) and Android smartphones list for $27. Products can take weeks to arrive. Shoppers scroll through an average 600 to 700 items, hypnotized by a pixelated parade of weird and wacky products that scratches the same visual itch as an Instagram feed. Around 80% of Wish's first-time customers will return to buy a second time.<br><br>Shipping is cheap thanks in part to an agreement between China Post and the U.S. Postal Service that allows goods that weigh 4.4 pounds or less to be shipped at low rates. About 15% of Wish's shipments qualify. It can now be cheaper to ship a package from Beijing to New York than from South Carolina to New York. That's important because many Chinese merchants can't afford to use big shipping companies like FedEx or DHL or store their goods in out-of-the-way ware­houses as they might with Amazon, says Zhang, who's based in Shanghai.<br><br>Wish is losing about $190 million annually, but it claims it could be profitable if it stopped spending so much on marketing. It has run big campaigns on Pandora and Snapchat, and it's one of the biggest advertisers on Facebook. In 2017 Wish signed a three-year, $30 million deal to sponsor the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers, who are popular in China. Los Angeles is also one of Wish's biggest metropolitan markets by revenue.<br><br>Given the competitive landscape, it's probably money well spent. Mark Zuckerberg recently talked of making it easier to sell stuff on Instagram, meaning Facebook could become a competitor. Amazon's third-party marketplace accounts for half of all the products it sells (by volume, but not revenue), up from 30% a decade ago. Taking dead aim at Wish, Amazon recently launched a \"Bargain Finds\" section. Meanwhile, in his efforts to throw heat at China, Donald Trump could upend the deal that makes shipping for some Wish merchants so cheap.<br><br>A more existential problem: Lots of the stuff on Wish is trashy, shoddy, even fraudulent. There are hundreds of negative reviews for Wish on review sites like Trustpilot and HighYa. Customers are unhappy about unresponsive customer service, merchants who don't send their orders and poor-quality goods. Szulczewski has hired Connie Chang, a former community manager at Facebook, to fix the problem. In an act of thrifty opportunism that would impress Jeff Bezos himself, she's organizing roughly 10,000 Wish users to help the company weed out shady merchants in exchange for free goods and discounts. But Szulczewski seems unfazed by the quality-control challenge, pointing out that sometimes customers themselves are the problem. \"We sell 5 million contact lenses a year,\" he says. \"Someone's going to sleep in them.\"<br><br>THE MAN WHO HAS 300 MILLION products for sale grew up surrounded by empty store shelves in 1980s communist Poland, on the third floor of a bland, six-story apartment block in Warsaw. He was 11 when the Soviet Union collapsed and his parents moved to Waterloo, Canada, which is about 70 miles west of Toronto and home to an excellent research university. He attended the University of Waterloo, which also counts the founders of Kik Interactive and Instacart as former students. In Szulczewski's math and computer science classes he met another immigrant, Danny Zhang. The two played soccer together—Zhang was so good he had briefly considered turning pro—and became friends.<br><br>In 2004, just before he graduated at 23, ­Szulczewski started a four-month internship at Google, which then had less than 1,000 employees and was gearing up for its IPO. He lived in a three-bedroom house in Palo Alto with three other interns, churning out code by day and pumping iron at night. \"You always got the sense that he didn't have time for, you know, messing around,\" says former Googler Brian Singerman, now a partner at the venture firm Founders Fund and an investor in Wish. Once he became a full-time Google employee, Szulczewski wrote the prototype algorithms for keyword expansion, a feature Google sold to early advertisers to help them expand the number of search terms they could show their ads against. A company selling running shoes, for instance, might forget to ask Google to target searches for \"sneakers,\" but Szulczewski's code silently added those keywords so they didn't have to. Advertisers spent more, and the feature added roughly $100 million to Google's annual revenue, Szulczewski claims.<br><br>In June 2007, Szulczewski transferred to Google's new office in South Korea and got a lesson in tech outside the Silicon Valley bubble. Koreans preferred search portals that were busy and crowded with information over clean, minimalist home pages like Google's. Former Google colleague Mark Rabkin remembers debating the point with Szulczewski when he visited. \"I could tell he was starting to think like a local,\" says Rabkin, who's now an ad executive at Facebook. The experience would help shape Szulczewski's strategy for Wish: He learned to focus on building something people wanted rather than what Silicon Valley thought they should want.<br><br>Szulczewski left Google in 2009 with enough savings to see him through the next two years. He spent six months at his home computer writing code for software that could predict someone's interests, such as running or gardening, based on their browsing behavior and match that to a potential product or advertisement, calling the system ContextLogic.<br><br>In September 2010, investors put $1.7 million into ContextLogic, the wheels greased by introductions from a friend of Szulczewski's, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman. \"Their business plan was to go compete with Google on AdWords, in Korea, or some crazy thing,\" remembers Jerry Yang, the billionaire cofounder of Yahoo, who invested in Wish through his angel fund, AME Cloud Ventures. But, he adds, \"their technology was really good.\"<br><br>The following May, in 2011, Szulczewski invited his old college friend Zhang, then at YellowPages.com, to join him as a cofounder. They toyed with building an ad business, then had lunch in San Francisco with Yang and the venture capital investor Joe Lonsdale to brainstorm bigger business ideas. E-commerce and mobile kept coming up. More people were using smartphones, but few were shopping on them. ­Szulczewski became convinced he just needed to apply the \"Google methodology\" of tracking every interaction, scroll and tap of a customer. Yang was skeptical. Amazon was already 17 years old and well established. \"I remember walking out and thinking, 'Man, this is a hard pivot,' \" Yang says.<br><br>Then things almost ended. In 2011 Facebook got wind of Szulczewski's recommendation engine and offered $20 million to integrate ContextLogic into its own ad system or, potentially, the software that ranked stories and posts on Facebook's news feed. When Szulczewski didn't take the money, one of his investors stormed into the startup's new office on Pine Street to chew him out. \"Go work for someone that's good at business,\" the investor told him.<br><br>Instead, Szulczewski kept tinkering. In late 2011 he and Zhang launched Wish's predecessor, Wishwall.me. Using ads on Facebook, they invited people to come and browse a collection of products curated by Wish. Wish didn't actually sell any of these products—other sites did that—but people could \"wish\" for things they wanted and create wish lists, say, for bicycling or home decorating. \"Some people are just into that,\" says Szulczewski.<br><br>As visitors \"liked\" the bathroom towels and bike speedometers, they earned rewards such as free items and discounts, so they stuck around. Wish amassed tens of thousands of users, and then started matchmaking. It sent emails to dozens of merchants who were actually selling these products on eBay and Amazon. Wish promised to introduce them to a pool of ready buyers, but only if the merchant knocked 10% to 20% off the price they were displaying elsewhere. To prioritize growth early on, Wish didn't take a commission. If the merchants agreed, Wish pinged its users to say the product they liked was now available for a discount on Wish.<br><br>When Hans Tung, an investor with GGV Capital in Menlo Park, California, met Szulczewski in October 2013 he was struck by a heat map. It showed that most of Wish's sales were coming not from New York and California but from Florida, Texas and the heartland of America. Tung immediately saw parallels with TaoBao, a peer-to-peer marketplace owned by Alibaba that was on track to become the world's biggest e-commerce site. TaoBao had shown there was an underserved, global market for cheap, unbranded goods but had stayed focused on China. \"Wish was TaoBao, on mobile, for the rest of the world,\" Tung says.<br><br>IN 2016 SZULCZEWSKI WALKED away from another bidder, this time his idol. An executive close to Jeff Bezos had reached out and invited Szulczewski to Seattle to meet the Amazon founder. Before the meeting, Szulczewski wrote to Bezos' executive assistant to clarify that he had no intention of selling his business. \"But he still wanted to meet,\" Szulczewski remembers. So he took the two-hour flight north for a full day of meetings at Amazon's headquarters. Citing a nondisclosure agreement that he signed, Szulczewski is reluctant to say much about what went on but says Bezos \"wasn't super-direct\" about making an acquisition offer. Amazon's corporate development attorneys were in the room, though, Szulczewski recalls, as they normally are in acquisition talks. \"There was an agenda,\" he says. (For its part, Amazon refuses to comment on \"speculation.\")<br><br>Wish's open-door policy meant that sales were taking off, but so were quality-control problems—which is somewhat inevitable when you have one million registered merchants, of whom 125,000 are active on Wish each month. By way of context, Amazon hosts an estimated 2.5 million active third-party merchants, while Walmart has roughly 21,000, according to Marketplace Pulse, a New York-based e-commerce intelligence firm.<br><br>\"I underestimated how challenging [quality control] is,\" says Szulczewski. As he walks through the open-plan floor of his San Francisco office, filled with social media staff, he gestures at the symbol of his biggest problem: a collection of cardboard boxes stacked to the ceiling. They're the site's most popular products that week, set to be riffled through by staff members for quality checks.<br><br>\"These merchants will do very interesting things,\" Szulczewski says, arching his eyebrows to suggest he has some stories to tell. Here's one: A merchant once offered tablet computers on Wish for 70 bucks, but customers got a small stand in the mail with a \"mostly English\" note saying the tablet was coming. It wasn't. Wish was criticized in press reports last year when makeup on the site was blamed for causing pinkeye. Some merchants have set up more than 1,000 accounts to evade policing. Another trick is to sell a product to great reviews, then source a different, cheaper version and keep showing the old reviews.<br><br>To tackle this, Wish automatically culls about 8 million products over a week, or close to 3% of all products available on the site. Most are cut because visitors have scrolled past an item at least 1,000 times and haven't tapped on it once. Wish also culls products from merchants who've received bad reviews or put up fake reviews. To automatically detect the fakes, Wish's engineers trained its software on reviews that were obviously made up. One example: \"Did not expect so soon, the owner of service enthusiasm.\" Now the software can identify reviews with similar nonsensical phrases.<br><br>Overall, there is a set of roughly 60 rules. If Wish's algorithms see that a merchant has listed counterfeit products or shipped an order with a fake tracking number, they'll be \"fined\" $500. Shipping a package with no product spells a potential $10,000 fine. Wish collects around $3 million a month in fines, and it can do that by simply withholding payments from merchants, says Szulczewski. Merchants can also get kicked off the platform, he adds. On the flip side, good reviews can lead to faster payments or a higher ranking in search.<br><br>Zhang, who is 6,000 miles away, overseeing operations in three locations in China with 150 staff members, is just as paranoid about being gamed. \"Merchants definitely care about making money first,\" Zhang says. The rules and monitoring software don't always go down well. \"The merchants look at Wish's platform as very robotic,\" he says, meaning there's no way for merchants to negotiate a better deal by cultivating personal relationships with Wish staff.<br><br>\"It'll never be perfect,\" admits Tung, the GGV investor. \"You get what you pay for.\" But Szulczewski paints a rosier picture. The flywheel of customer data going into Wish will mean more reviews, smarter targeting software and, eventually, better-quality items. Those unbranded smartphones will get better every year, he says, \"just like our iPhones.\"",

      "content": "Facebook estimated it will notify \"hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users, tens of millions of other Facebook users, and tens of thousands of Instagram users,\" wrote Pedro Canahuati, the company's vice president of engineering, security and privacy, in a blog post Thursday.<br><br>Facebook Lite is a stripped-down version of the product for use by people without access to reliable internet service.<br><br>The breach appears similar to others that have occurred at tech companies, including Twitter Inc., which asked 331 million users to change their passwords in May after discovering that one of its internal systems logged users' unencrypted passwords.<br><br>Because so many people reuse their passwords, they have emerged as a major security problem for tech companies. Password databases have become a prime target for cyber thieves, and hackers will often try a user's stolen password to break into new sites. Most companies, including Facebook, monitor the internet for publicly released databases of passwords.<br><br>\"Passwords are extremely sensitive data,\" said Deirdre K. Mulligan, an associate professor at University of California Berkeley, who specializes in data privacy. \"If passwords are being stored in the clear, accessible by thousands of employees, one can only imagine how poorly other data is being managed,\" she said.<br><br>Facebook's data-security lapse attracted more attention than similar stumbles elsewhere given persistent criticism of how the company collects, stores and deploys its users' data.<br><br>It also contradicts at least some of the company's previous assurances on the matter. In a 2014 post about password security, Facebook's then-security engineer Chris Long wrote that \"no one here has your plain text password.\"<br><br>Facebook identified that it did log plain-text passwords as part of a security review in January, Mr. Canahuati said.<br><br>During the review, Facebook has been looking for ways it stores some information, such as access tokens, and have fixed problems as they were discovered, he said. While Facebook will notify users whose passwords were stored insecurely \"as a precaution,\" there is no current plan to require users to change their passwords.<br><br>The security lapse follows a data breach six months ago in which Facebook said attackers managed to extract data such as name, gender and hometown for around 50 million users.<br><br>It also comes amid a wide-ranging Federal Trade Commission review of Facebook's privacy policies and handling of user data. Though that probe began following a scandal over how political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user data, Facebook has said it kept the FTC abreast of other privacy and data-handling lapses.<br><br>Storing passwords in an encrypted format is \"not just best practice, it's something that industry should always do,\" said Jennifer Granick, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union.<br><br>\"Facebook's failure to do that will really upset the FTC,\" Ms. Granick said.<br><br>The internal exposure of passwords was reported by krebsonsecurity.com on Thursday.<br><br>Citing an unnamed senior Facebook executive, independent security researcher Brian Krebs wrote that as many as 600 million passwords were exposed, with some being improperly stored as far back as 2012. According to Mr. Krebs's report, the files containing the passwords were accessible to as many as 20,000 Facebook employees, and about 2,000 company developers and engineers interacted with the system that contained them.<br><br>Facebook's hashing algorithm, known internally as \"the onion,\" is made up of a series of cryptographic techniques that evolved over time and are used internally to obfuscate data such as user passwords.<br><br>Mr. Canahuati's post didn't explain why a vast quantity of login information had not been treated in that fashion in this instance, and Facebook didn't respond to a request for additional information about what purpose the logged data served.<br><br>The risk of mistakes like Facebook's are greater within large companies because teams of engineers are often working on unrelated projects with different goals, said Chris Vickery, a security researcher for Upguard.<br><br>\"This was logs of the passwords arriving, data in transit,\" Mr. Vickery said. \"Whoever designed the logging system didn't have passwords in mind. Whoever designed the database that stored passwords probably didn't know this existed.\"<br><br>Even if no users were harmed by the mistake, Mr. Vickery said, the sloppiness in handling user data is \"another example of bad data governance as a culture at Facebook.\"<br><br>Facebook has been under fire for much of the past year over data-security issues and concerns over how it monitors the platform.<br><br>Even against that backdrop, the past week has been a difficult one for the Menlo Park, Calif., company. Last week the company's chief product officer and the head of its WhatsApp division resigned unexpectedly, a move seen as reflective of intense debate within the company over its direction.<br><br>This week the company has had to answer questions about its response to the video of the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooting, which was live-streamed on Facebook and remained on the site for half an hour after a user brought it to the company's attention.<br><br>The company also announced the settlement of a lawsuit alleging that it had discriminated against some users by allowing housing, employment and credit-related ads to be targeted according to gender, age and ZIP Code. Facebook paid less than $5 million and agreed to end the practice.<br><br>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service",

However, this particular video did not trigger our automatic detection systems,” Rosen said in the post, adding that no users reported the video during the live broadcast.<br><br>Facebook took down the video after being alerted by New Zealand authorities.

      "title": "Facebook crumbles around its lonely king; Shareholders gave Mark Zuckerberg all the power, and now watch as top executives walk away from his iron-fisted rule",
      "content": "He can, of course, do what he wants, because the company is truly a Mark Zuckerberg production, and because he has always had what Silicon Valley founders crave: founder control of his company. As more executives depart, Facebook appears to be heading further under Zuckerberg’s total rule.<br><br>Facebook (FB, US) has suffered seemingly endless controversies, including the most recent, hosting a live stream of mass shootings in two mosques in New Zealand. Facebook was alerted by the police in Christchurch to remove the video, which was not found by any of Facebook’s AI engines or humans searching for violent content, contrary to Zuckerberg’s explanation to Congress a year ago about how its systems are getting better at finding harmful content. Facebook said in a blog post this week that in the first 24 hours of the shootings, it removed about 1.5 million videos of the attack globally, with more than 1.2 million of those videos blocked at upload.<br><br>The massacres happened two days after a massive outage and a day after a top executive left amid reported unhappiness with Zuckerberg’s new direction, outlined in a manifesto that was long on words while being short on detail. It appears Zuckerberg has dug himself into a foxhole, where he is following his inner instincts and intuition for the company he started up with his roommates at Harvard 15 years ago. Needham & Co. analyst Laura Martin, citing recent events plus a looming threat of regulation, said the combined risks are creating a negative network effect for Facebook.<br><br>Investors who may be unhappy with the continued chaos know their hands are tied even if they don’t agree with how Zuckerberg is ruling over his kingdom. Zuckerberg still controls about 60% of Facebook’s votes. The departure of a key lieutenant — longtime product chief Chris Cox — on top of the loss of the founders of Instagram and WhatsApp, signal growing internal turmoil, with a CEO more alone at the top.<br><br>Read more about Silicon Valley’s poor corporate governance through its embrace of founder control<br><br>“There have been some significant high-level departures that have raised a lot of concerns,” said Jonas Kron, who leads shareholder advocacy efforts at Trillium Asset Management, an employee-owned investment-management firm based in Boston. “Then you top it off with New Zealand, and a 12-hour outage, it’s sort of hard to keep up.”<br><br>Last October, Trillium submitted a shareholder proposal with the backing of several state treasurers, representing about 5 million shares, asking Facebook’s board to appoint an independent chairman.<br><br>“There is a lot going on, and the company would greatly benefit from having Mark Zuckerberg focus on management and execution, and have an independent board chair focusing on the board and relations with investors and board oversight,” he said.<br><br>Throughout the many crises that the company has endured following the U.S. elections in 2016, Zuckerberg has appeared to listen to no one but possibly Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. The New York Times reported late last year that Zuckerberg and Sandberg ignored repeated warning signs of some of the many problems that have bedeviled Facebook.<br><br>There have been anecdotal reports about some Facebook employees looking for new jobs or not feeling comfortable giving dissenting opinions amid Zuckerberg’s tight control. In January, CNBC reported on the company’s cult-like culture and how the fear among some employees to give honest feedback may have contributed to the scandals that have enveloped the company.<br><br>Two weeks ago, Zuckerberg surprised investors and users with a more-than-3,000-word pledge to improve privacy, admitting, in the understatement of the year, that Facebook “does not have a strong reputation for privacy.” Facebook now plans to work on a single encrypted-messaging platform, a move that Cox obviously disagreed with by his resignation.<br><br>Cox was not the only key executive to depart in the past few months. Last fall, co-founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram left in disagreements over the directions Zuckerberg wanted to take their platforms, a few years after their acquisitions by Facebook. He had initially promised to leave the companies alone, running them as subsidiaries. In Martin’s note, in which the Needham analyst also downgraded the stock to a hold, she highlighted 11 senior executive departures over the past several months.<br><br>“A Negative Network Effect suggests that departures will continue, and since we believe that people are a key competitive advantage of FAANG companies, this implies accelerating value destruction until senior executive turnover ends,” Martin wrote. ‘We prefer to move to the sidelines until we see senior employee turnover stabilize.”<br><br>The pressure to produce continued revenue growth as well as generate revenue at its other properties, Instagram and WhatsApp, even as user growth at Facebook declines, have led Zuckerberg to make some severe decisions. Those decisions could just lead to more controversies, however.<br><br>After his privacy manifesto, which talked about encrypting all messages, many worried that Facebook would be increasingly used for more evil means, and that the company would not be able to police abuses on its network or to help law enforcement. Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor and co-founder of Elevation Partners, believes that even with encryption of messages, the company’s core business model remains intact. Messaging is “a tiny fraction of the data and metadata that matters,” for Facebook’s business model, he said, because it can continue to glean information about its users for targeted advertising through newsfeed and story activity.<br><br>“The manifesto leaves FB’s business model unchanged. That is not acceptable,” McNamee said in an email. “The business model amplifies hate speech, disinformation, and conspiracy theories, with increasingly severe consequences, such as the terrorism in New Zealand.”<br><br>Read about McNamee’s new book, which talks about the problems at Facebook and his solutions<br><br>Whether Zuckerberg’s decisions and instincts are correct or not, Facebook investors have to trust him. Because he still has voting control, the company’s board and its investors just have to agree or vote with their feet, since they don’t technically have any real say. Some day, Zuckerberg may end up as a poster child for the concept of the gradual elimination of founder control and dual-class shares, a proposal that some officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission support, which would put some sort of time limit on founder control of a company.<br><br>Jonas of Trillium believes that is an imperfect solution.<br><br>“The better approach is just not to have dual-class at all,” he said. “One share, one vote.”<br><br>But while more investors are speaking out against dual-class stock and founder control in public companies, the concept is becoming even more popular as a new wave of major IPOs starts to hit U.S. markets. Ride-hailing app developer Lyft’s prospectus revealed it is going to go public with dual-class stock, with its two founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, expected to have control. That’s after rival Uber Technology Inc.’s well-documented problems with its controlling co-founder, Travis Kalanick. A D.A. Davidson analyst wrote in a note this week that Lyft gained riders after the spate of scandals at Uber, ranging from a culture of widespread sexual harassment to software used to deceive regulators, that ultimately led to Kalanick’s ouster.<br><br>At Facebook’s next annual meeting, likely to be held in May, shareholders will have an opportunity to voice their displeasure with some of Zuckerberg’s recent decisions and his reign in general. But with Zuckerberg’s control and the votes stacked against them, why would they even bother?<br><br>“The goal is to give investors the opportunity to express an opinion about whether an independent board chair is a good idea or not and to give the board that information,” Jonas said. “If a majority of outside shareholders agree to that, even if its only 40%, that’s an opinion that I think everyone would agree should be taken seriously.”<br><br>Investors need to remember that at founder-controlled companies, when the going gets tough, they don’t really have much say. They can try to send messages to management and the board, through things like shareholder resolutions, but the founder/controlling shareholder always has the final say.",

      "content": "The live-streaming video was taken by the shooter as he began<br><br>a rampage that left 50 people dead Friday afternoon. The broadcast began on Facebook at around 1:33 p.m. and ended 17 minutes later at approximately 1:50 p.m. A Facebook user flagged the post to the company 12 minutes after that, Facebook said. The social media team of the New Zealand police alerted Facebook to the video at 2:29 p.m., police told the Journal. Facebook said it took the video down within minutes thereafter.<br><br>New Zealand police said the timeline was approximately correct. Facebook declined to comment.<br><br>The delay was the result of a string of gaps in systems Facebook has set up to stop violent videos and other objectionable content from appearing on its platform. Artificial intelligence programs the company relies upon to block bad content failed to catch the video during its live broadcast and afterward. Then the alert from the user, who flagged the video after the broadcast ended, wasn't fast-tracked, because Facebook prioritizes warnings about suicide attempts in such cases.<br><br>By the time the video was taken down, it had been viewed 4,000 times on the site, Facebook said.

These were foreseeable.\"<br><br>Facebook has said it is doing more to moderate the large numbers of posts that go online. It has doubled down on AI as a solution, in addition to using some 15,000 human content reviewers. In a post on the company's website Wednesday, Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president for integrity, acknowledged limitations in the company's handling of live broadcasts and said the company's artificial intelligence tools hadn't been able to catch the video.<br><br>\"We recognize that the immediacy of Facebook Live brings unique challenges,\" he wrote in his post on the company's website.<br><br>The killings last week left New Zealand reeling.

In the past, they have included live beatings and murders.<br><br>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison asked over the weekend whether Facebook should be allowed to offer services such as live videos if it can't control them.<br><br>Some critics have called on the site to impose a time delay during which videos could be checked.

The company said last year that Facebook itself—not its users—was identifying nearly all of the material related to Islamic State and al Qaeda that it removed. But the platform, accessed each month by some 2 billion users posting in more than 80 languages, hasn't had that success with other kinds of extremist content.<br><br>In his post, Mr. Rosen said artificial intelligence has worked well to identify nudity and terrorist propaganda, because there are lots of examples of such content to train the machines. But the AI didn't have enough material to learn to recognize content like the mosque massacre, he said, because \"these events are thankfully rare.\"<br><br>Once the video was flagged by a user, it appeared to get stuck in queue to be reviewed. Mr. Rosen said the social media site accelerates its review of all live videos that are flagged by users while they are still being broadcast. The policy also applies to videos that have recently ended, but only in the case of suicide reports. The Christchurch video wasn't reported as a suicide and as a result wasn't prioritized.<br><br>The company will re-examine its procedures and expand the categories for accelerated review, Mr. Rosen said.<br><br>Mr. Farid, the Dartmouth professor, said the delay in taking the video down even after it was flagged by a user shows Facebook's legions of content checkers aren't enough for a platform of Facebook's size.<br><br>Some of New Zealand's largest advertisers, including ASB Bank, suspended advertising on Facebook and Google after the shooter's video was posted.<br><br>Lindsay Mouat, the CEO of the Association of New Zealand Advertisers, said New Zealand corporations \"are just appalled with the way that live video streaming of what happened could actually get up and occur in Facebook Live without any moderation.\"<br><br>Facebook's systems caught 1.2 million videos of the attack as they were being uploaded in the first 24 hours; another 300,000 made it to the site and were removed afterward.
